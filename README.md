<h1>PaintWar</h1>

This plugin is a minigame that is sort of like paintball, but instead of shooting other players, you try to cover the ground in "paint."

<h3>Features/Commands</h3>
Several commands and features have been added so far, but this plugin is far from completed. As of right now, you can create a PaintWar game by selecting a cuboid region with WorldEdit and using /pw create &lt;name&gt;. Games are started with /pw start &lt;name&gt; and stopped with /pw stop &lt;name&gt;. Players join the game with /pw join &lt;name&gt;. They will be sorted into two teams: red and blue. They will be given an iron horse armor "paintball gun" that can shoot infinite snowballs. Right now, whatever they shoot at will turn into stained clay in their team's color. **That will be fixed eventually.** Players' XP bars are timers for the game. Players can leave with /pw leave. Their inventories will be restored. When used without any arguments, /pw list shows a list of PaintWar games. When used with a game name as the argument, it lists players who are currently playing in that game. Status and time left of games can be gotten with /pw status &lt;name&gt;.

<h3>Planned Features</h3>
* This will eventually be a full minigame.
* There will be two gamemodes (names are not final): fill your side, where you try to be the first team to fill your side and fill the whole map, where you try to fill more of the map than the other team in a set amount of time.
* More gamemodes may be added.
* &#x2713;<strike>You will only be able to shoot the ground.</strike>
* Ways to kill other players, such as bows or swords will probably be added.
* Powerups may be added.
