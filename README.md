<h1>PaintWar</h1>
This plugin is a minigame that is sort of like paintball, but instead of shooting other players, you try to cover the ground in "paint."

<h3>Features/Commands</h3>
Several commands and features have been added so far, but this plugin is far from completed. As of right now, you can start a PaintWar game with /pwstart. Then, players join the game with /pwjoin. They will be sorted into two teams: red and blue. They will be given an infinite snowball. Right now, whatever they shoot at will turn into stained clay in their team's color. **That will be fixed eventually.** Players can leave with /pwleave. Games can be stopped with /pwstop. /pwlist shows a list of players who are currently playing. /pwstatus shows whether or not a PaintWar game is running.

<h3>Permissions</h3>
There are permissions for each command:
* /pwstart - paintwar.start
* /pwstop - paintwar.stop
* /pwjoin - paintwar.join
* /pwleave - paintwar.leave
* /pwstatus - paintwar.status
* /pwlist - paintwar.list

<h3>Planned Features</h3>
* This will eventually be a full minigame.
* There will be two gamemodes (names are not final): fill your side, where you try to be the first team to fill your side and fill the whole map, where you try to fill more of the map than the other team in a set amount of time.
* More gamemodes may be added.
* You will only be able to shoot the ground.
* Ways to kill other players, such as bows or swords will probably be added.
* Powerups may be added.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or error reports, please leave them on the BukkitDev site.
